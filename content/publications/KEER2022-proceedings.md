abstract: "The 9th International Conference on Kansei Engineering and Emotion Research (KEER2022) took place from 6 th to 8 th September 2022 (with an informal doctoral symposium the afternoon of 5 th September). The hosting city, Barcelona, is bathed by the Mediterranean Sea. Since ancient times, the Mediterranean has been a link between the East and the West, between the South and the North, and a way to share knowledge, technology and skills among very diverse peoples and cultures. Therefore, this edition of KEER revolved around the notion of diversities. Diversities of cultures, diversities of practices, diversities of perspectives, diversities of places, diversities of experiences. These diversities and their encounters are sources of richness. Understanding and experimenting with diversities in mind leads towards a greater comprehension of kansei. What we tried to do with the conference was encouraging discussion on the consideration of diversities as an encounter, bringing us together on the topic of kansei."
