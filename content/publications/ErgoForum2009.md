abstract: "Through the example of three projects, this paper describes emerging methods and means used in the field of Kansei design studies:<br/>- The use of tools built for psychophysiology and for constructive psychology in order to support designers’ work focusing on human beings’ behaviours and mental schemes;<br/>- The use of knowledge created by psychophysiological research as an inspirational source for industrial design, taking into consideration the latest scientific progress in psychophysiology;<br/>- The use of psychophysiology tools to complete design requirements. Each point presented here is supported by an applicative example."
