abstract: "We see a growing interest in sharing data and a growing desire to give meaning and understanding to data. Data sharing has great potential to promote people’s health and vitality by encouraging collaboration across a variety of parties. Nevertheless, the use of data lags behind due to the lack of consideration of various users’ requirements in designing data sharing platforms. Despite the needs of the socio-technical aspect for designing data platforms, studies in this regard are still limited. In this paper, we present our study to understand diverse requirements from stakeholders for the development of a vitality data sharing platform by identifying what kind of data is related to vitality. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with two groups of stakeholders: (i) representatives of organizations involved in vitality (N=8), and (ii) citizens (N=20). From these interviews, we see that vitality and vitality data are multidimensional and got an insight into the different expectations on such a data platform among the stakeholders. The representatives of organizations involved in vitality, generally expect low-level data. On the other hand, citizens strive to gain more general information. Our findings suggest that various levels of information are required on data platforms as well as social discussion features to enhance the connection among multi-stakeholder."
