abstract: "This collection of infographics is a visual journey through the development, the application, and the communication of our approach in designing for transforming practices. This is a collection of perspectives: how do we view and shape societal transformation through a dialogue across different standpoints? While the work is grounded in design research as the driving tradition of knowledge production, the collection embraces multiple kinds: disciplinary, cultural, social, and organisational perspectives. It respects the systemic nature of the act of transforming. The purpose of the upcoming pages is not to propose clear-cut solutions regarding how to achieve societal goals, but rather to sketch a landscape of learnings, experiences, and opportunities for a specific kind of transformation to happen. One could see this collection as a teaser for a bigger journey through uncharted territories of transforming practices. Buckle up and we hope you enjoy the journey."
