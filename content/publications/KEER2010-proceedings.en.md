abstract: "On behalf of Arts et Métiers ParisTech, it is my great pleasure to welcome you to Paris for the International Conference on Kansei Engineering and Emotion Research: KEER 2010.<br/>This event has been co-organized by the Japanese Society of Kansei Engineering, the Taiwan Institute of Kansei, and Arts et Métiers ParisTech. KEER 2010 is organized for the first time in Europe, more specifically in Paris. We are all the more proud to host this conference within our School, which is one of the oldest Schools of Engineering in France, with a culture that focuses strongly on innovation in technology and processes.<br/>The overall theme of the conference is ‘Crossing places, crossing experiences, crossing minds’. We sincerely hope that the conference will set a strong ground for future scientific and cultural exchanges. With time, we hope that the contacts you will make here will help construct long-lasting bridges between our cultures, and bring us closer together in mutually beneficial work relationships. We have been fortunate this year to receive many contributions from 25 countries worldwide, which added up to 410 submitted papers and posters, over 230 of which were selected in the final program. In the next three days, we have organized 7 simultaneous sessions to host presentations from the authors, as well as two keynote presentations every day. We hope each and every one of you will find nourishment for your scientific curiosity and for future lively and fascinating debates.<br/>I am greatly thankful to all authors for their excellent contributions, to the program committee members, and to the referees for their contribution and valuable insight during the reviewing process. I would also like to thank all the people who have helped with organizing the conference: Prof. Hisao SHIIZUKA (Kogakuin University, President of JSKE), Prof. Kuohsiang CHEN (National Cheng-Kung University), Prof. Toshimasa YAMANAKA (University of Tsukuba), Prof. Yu-Ming CHANG (Southern Taiwan Universty of Technology), Assistant Prof. Pierre LEVY (Eindhoven University of Technology) and Assistant Prof. Carole BOUCHARD (Arts et Métiers ParisTech). Particular thanks go to the members of the KEER 2010 organizing committee here in Arts et Métiers ParisTech.<br/>Welcome to Paris. We wish you all a very fruitful and convivial conference.<br/><br/><i>Améziane AOUSSAT</i><br/><i>Conference Chair</i>"
