abstract: "The beginnings of a new European Renaissance can be felt in many places, including the Swedish city of Umeå, where a new Smart Bus Station was realised. This ‘Station of Being’ aimed at transforming today’s practices and exploring new sustainable futures based on values such as beauty and diversity. In this chapter, we describe ‘Station of Being’, the approach that was used, namely, Designing for Transforming Practices, the societal transformations it triggered, and how it supports the flourishing of a new civilization."
