abstract: "My name is Pierre Lévy. I am currently assistant professor at the Department of Industrial Design of Eindhoven University of Technology. I have been studying in France, in Canada, and in Japan. I have studied mathematics, mechanical engineering, psychophysiology, and design (which has been the continuous topic over my studies). I have been working in companies in France and in Japan, and in universities in Japan, in France, and in The Netherlands. My teachings have touched upon design, cognitive science, phenomenology, Japanese culture, and psychophysiology (all topics in regard to design).
From this I can satisfactorily see that I have been ‘travelling’ in the world of design education, and writing for the BKO portfolio is for me an opportunity to step back, and reflect on my vision, my role, and my work as an educator."
