abstract: "Linköping University is one of the largest universities in Sweden. Since the start in the late 60’s, Linköping University has been an innovator, creating new study programmes and new ways to tackle research problems. Innovation has become our tradition.<br />Since 1999 an interdisciplinary group of researchers has been working with affective aspects in product development and with Kansei Engineering in particular. Since then we have grown into an international group and now feature a lab for concept realization (CRL) in which both students and senior researchers can develop new attractive products. We are proud to host this year’s KEER conference here in Linköping we hope you will all enjoy our hospitality and that our tradition of interdisciplinary reach will be fruitful for the event."
