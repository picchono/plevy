abstract: "In this paper, we inquire aesthetical aspects of the Japanese tea ceremony, described as the aesthetics in the imperfection, based on novel fabrication technologies: 3D-modeling and 3D-printing. To do so, 3D-printed utensils (chashaku and chasen) were iteratively designed for the ceremony and were evaluated using constructivist interviews, eliciting personal construct of a tea master on the beauty of these utensils. Our findings  suggest  that  (1)  beauty  in  the  imperfection  is feasible with 3D-printers, (2) such beauty can be created at the  mechanical  limits  of  the  printer  and  of  the  material, creating uncontrolled yet beautiful irregularities, (3) furtherresearch can be made on the dialogue between the designer and  the  machine,  leaving  space for  beautiful  mechanical uncertainty. We invite designers and design researchers (1) to look at the potential of new technologies beyond what is classically  expected,  (2)  to  consider  other  cultural perspectives  on  aesthetics  and  on  making,  leading  to potential novel practices in design."
