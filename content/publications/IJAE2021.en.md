abstract: "Despite the great potential of data platforms to help solve societal issues, the actual usage of data platforms is still limited due to the lack of consideration of socio-technical aspects. To understand requirements from multiple actors on a vitality data platform, semi-structured interviews were conducted with three groups of actors: representatives of organizations involved in vitality (N=8), government officials (N=10), and citizens (N=20). From these interviews, we got an understanding of the multidimensionality of vitality data and got an insight into the different expectations on the vitality data platform among those actors. Citizens strive to gain general information such as advice for healthy living. On the other hand, the two other groups of participants generally expect low-level data. Our findings suggest that data has to be presented in multiple formats and social discussion features are required to connect those different actors on data platforms."
