abstract: "The research presented in this paper is part of the last target of Kansei research for design. Its aim is to build up a design method for interdisciplinary workgroup context. The bases of this method have been published in the past [Lévy 2006]. In this paper, this method and a more practical way to apply it will be introduced, before presenting a case study output from a course taught from April to November 2007 to Master students."
