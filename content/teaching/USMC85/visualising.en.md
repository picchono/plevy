## EXERCISE - Drawing a map
Draw the map of the ground floor of Cnam Conté (10min).  
Compare to the actual map (provided in class)


## Introduction
**Visualisation** is any technique for creating images, diagrams, or animations to communicate a message. Visualization through visual imagery has been an effective way to communicate both abstract and concrete ideas since the dawn of humanity (wikipedia).

## EXERCISE - Drawing a map
Draw the map of the ground floor of Cnam Conté (10min).  
Compare to the actual map (provided in class)

### Considerations
- Know your audience and the aim of your communication - This will impact every aspect of the visualisation
- Tell a story
- Keep your visualisations simple and digestible

### Structural elements
Visualisation focuses on purpose, clarity, inviting and effective communication of data. Key principles include:
- Have a clear purpose for your visualisation that aligns with the message you want to convey and the way you want the audience to receive your message. Tailoring visuals to the specific audience ensures comprehension and impact.
- Choose the right visualisation type based on the structure and nature of your data. For example, use Sankey diagrams to show flows, radar charts for comparing variables, waterfall charts for running totals, and Gantt charts for timelines. Select charts that accurately represent the story without clutter.
- Maintain consistency across the entire work to avoid confusion. 
- Use predictable layout patterns for an obvious reading flow, so viewers are guided through the story.
- Avoid clutter, unnecessary decoration (aka chartjunk), and overly complex visuals. Keep designs simple and focused on communicating the essential information. 
- If you design a dashboard, limit the number of visualisations (3-4 recommended) to aid understanding and engagement. Group related filters or controls and make the dashboard visually attractive and easy to navigate.[](https://www.xenonstack.com/blog/best-practices-data-visualization)
- Apply colour intentionally and strategically. Use colour to highlight key information and create contrast for readability. Stick to a simple colour palette and use intuitive associations. Avoid using too many colours or shades that blend data.
- Keep the quality of the visual (resolution for pixels vs vectorialisation) for the type of presentation (print vs screen).

### Tools
There are many tools to do illustration:
- do not underestimate drawing by hand!  
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) / [Krita](https://krita.org/) / Canva

### Visualising assignment
Deliverable: all the visualisations, all the prompts, and your quick reflections, all  organised in a timely order.

You are assessed on your reflections, the apparent construction towards the construction of a better text, so I can understand why the last one is best.
The exercise should not take more than 1h.
