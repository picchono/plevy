## Introduction
**Writing** is the act of creating a persistent representation of human language *(Wikipedia on writing)*. It is both a cognitive and social activity  
**Writing** is a means :
- to create durable traces of content,
- to transmit information over time,
- to externalise one's thoughts for reflexion.

## Structure
A text is usually composed of paragraph, in which are sentences, in which are words.
- the **text** demonstrates a point on a topic (to be convincing).
- the **paragraph** brings an argument to the demonstration.
- The **sentence** provides an information (not two) usefull to bring forth the argument.
- The **word** specify the elements involved in the piece of information (either being an object or an action).

&nbsp;

When you write, or more importantly review a writing you have done before submitting it, check each sentence asking yourself if:
- is this sentence useful for the argument I am trying to provide. If not, remove it and read again the paragraph.
- is the words are the proper ones or is there better ones. If not, look for better ones.
- is my argument is clear. If not.. do it again.

## Proposition of a structure of text
### IMRAD papers
There are many ways a text can be structured, especially depending on the style (plain, middle, grand). Yet here is a proposition for a safe (i.e. classic) structure:
- **Title:** A clear, engaging title that encapsulates the project. A good title is memorable, and tells well what we will read.
(**Bonus, yet not easy:** A good spoiler engage well the reader and empower the rhetoric. The reader should be strongly engaged and motivated/curious to know more.)  
- **Contextualising the project:** Providing a brief overview of the current state of the field, the place and the context of the project, the related issues helps to figure out why it matters. Discuss the societal, ecological, technical, or cultural motivations behind the research. Why is this work necessary? What gaps does it address?
- **Research Problem/Challenge:** Clearly defining the specific problem or question your research will tackle structures all the approach you will take and underline the significancy of the project in relation with the context.
- **Objectives:** Outlining the primary goals of the research creates a link with the problem/challenge and will support the choice of the
- **Methodology:** Be brief on explaining what is to be done, what the technology involved, what the measurement/analysis approaches. Be specific (plain style).
- **Output:** Briefly describe what you expect to find.
- **Outcome:** Reopen the discussion by describing the potential implications of your findings for society, ecology, technology, or culture.
- **Conclusion:** One or two sentences to get from the problem/challenge to the contributions to the field or to the society.
- **References** (if applicable): Include key literature or prior research that supports your project.

## Tools
There are many tools to write a text:
- do not underestimate handwriting!  
- [OnlyOffice](https://www.onlyoffice.com/) / [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download-libreoffice/) / [OpenOffice Writer](https://www.openoffice.org/product/writer.html)  
- MS word/Google docs  
- [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) (via [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) or by [installing it](https://www.latex-project.org/get/))  
- [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) (eg. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) / [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) / [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) / [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) / [Neovim](https://neovim.io/))
- publishing apps

## References
Referring others' work that is used in your text is important for multiple reasons:
- contextualise your work 
- contribute to a community of work 
- validate the depth of your work 
- acknowledge others' work 
- specify your own contribution

## Publishing
- Determine your public and select the places they access.
- For scientific publications, you may refer to the impact factors of journals (e.g., [SJR](https://www.scimagojr.com/)) and of confernces (e.g., [Conferenceranks](http://www.conferenceranks.com/)).

### Impact Factor
The **impact factor**  (**IF**) or  **journal impact factor**  (**JIF**) of an academic journal is a scientometric index calculated by Clarivate that reflects the yearly mean number of citations of articles published in the last two years in a given journal, as indexed by Clarivate's Web of Science.

As a journal-level metric, it is frequently used as a proxy for the relative importance of a journal within its field; journals with higher impact factor values are given the status of being more important, or carry more prestige in their respective fields, than those with lower values.

While frequently used by universities and funding bodies to decide on promotion and research proposals, it has been criticised for distorting good scientific practices.

## Writing assignment
- Take 10min max to write a text about your topic for a layperson - 250 words max
- Ask AI to do the same (250 words max)
- Compare and discuss the AI output from your expert perspective (250 words max)
- You can discuss with your AI to improve its text
- Propose a new text (as a result of your discussion with the AI and with you own final touch)  **The more concise the better!**

Deliverable: all the texts, all the prompts, and your quick reflections, all  organised in a timely order.

You are assessed on your reflections, the apparent construction towards the construction of a better text, so I can understand why the last one is best.
The exercise should not take more than 1h.
