The ambition of a dialogue is to learn from each other in the exchange (the *commun*ication) between the people in interaction. Also it can be appreciated, it is not the point to agree at the end of the exchange. The point is to work on the effect which the encountering of somebody else's viewpoint has on one's own viewpoint. In other words, is to learn from the other, and provide content for the other to learn from oneself's viewpoint and arguments.  Therefore, the dialogue works well when what is put in common is good enough for each participant to learn and grow out of this moment.

To do so the way arguments are communicated are important. They need to be exposed in a way that they are graspable, understandable, criticizable, adaptable… They need to be arranged so that they are useful for the other's reflection.  That will be the challenge of this course through three ways used in academic ativities : writing, visualising and presenting.
