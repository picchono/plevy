In this two-week workshop, theories of interaction design are explained and explored through applications. The DQI approach to Interaction Design is theory informed. This means that theory inspires and even guides the way we look at interaction, and the way we design for interaction and experience.

{{< slash "Topics" >}}
- Phenomenology and experience (Merlau-Ponty and Dewey)  
- Gibsonian theory of perception  
- Models of interaction: Interaction Frogger  
- Resonance  
- Rich Interaction  
- Societal Design  
- Craftsmanship

These theories, philosophies and models will be explained first and then  explored in a series of interaction designs, i.e. practical applications.
