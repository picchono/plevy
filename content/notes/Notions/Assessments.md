## Summative assessment

Summative assessment, refers to the assessment of participants where the focus is on the outcome of a program. The goal of summative assessment is to evaluate student learning at the end of an instructional unit , an entire course or module of study by comparing it against a standard. The definition of summative assessment is any method of evaluation that allows a teacher to measure a student’s understanding, typically against standardized criteria. The purpose of summative assessment is to gauge students’ comprehension of the material presented at the end of a particular unit of work. Summative assessments require clear expectations and timelines to be set to give students the best opportunity to succeed.

## **Formative assessment**

Formative assessment is a range of both formal and informal assessment procedures. Formative assessment summarizes the participants’ development at a particular time. The method allows teachers to check their learners’ progress as well as the effectiveness of their own practice, thus allowing for self assessment of the student. Formative assessment is a tool that assess the capacity of our students about what the students will learn, and how their learning progresses. It’s also a tool for teachers and students to communicate their progress and needs during a lesson. The focus is on the needs, understanding, and progress of each learning activities

## **Ipsative assessment**

In education, an ipsative assessment compares a learner’s current performance with previous performance either in the same field through time or in comparison with other fields, resulting in a descriptor expressed in terms of their ‘personal best’. It’s a highly personalized form of assessment where progress is measured against the needs and goals of the individual, not in comparison to external standards or performance of peers. Ipsative assessment is inevitably subjective and not amenable to comparisons (low validity) or standardisation. At some point a standard is needed for an award so perhaps a “blend” of ipsative and criteria-referenced approaches is the way forward.

## **Authentic assessment**

Authentic assessment is the measurement of ”intellectual accomplishments that are worthwhile, significant, and meaningful. When applying authentic assessment to student learning and achievement, a teacher applies criteria related to “construction of knowledge, disciplined inquiry, and the value of achievement beyond the school. Authentic assessment tends to focus on contextualised tasks, enabling students to demonstrate their competency in a more ’authentic’ setting. Because most authentic assessments require a judgement of the degree of quality, they tend toward the subjective end of the assessment scale. Rubrics are an ”attempt to make subjective measurements as objective, clear, consistent, and as defensible as possible by explicitly defining the criteria on which performance or achievement should be judged.
