<p><em>SHIFT is the product of 18 master students working within OPENLIGHT, the creative lab of the Intelligent Lighting Institute at TU/e.**</em></p>
<p>Our world is in a constant state of transformation. Most of the time, our view of the world will change parallel to this transformation. The changes in the world are often propelled us as an individual, group, generation or country. Are we aware of the influence we have on our environment? The installation allows you to experience and admire this influence by joining forces with others.<br>Your acts have meaning!</p>
<p>Students of the Intelligent Lighting Institute of Eindhoven University of Technology want to make visitors of GLOW 2012 think about the amount of control we have on the changing façade of the world. The visitors will be able to experience individual and collective influence on the world around them by collectively replacing weight.</p>
<p><em><b>Students:</b> Sietse Dols, Rik Vegt, Evy Ansems, Dennis de Klein, Thom van Boheemen, Nick Hermans, Karin Niemantsverdriet, Troy Reugebrink, Tijmen van Gurp, Job Huberts, Daniël van Paesschen, Martijn Peeters, Jelle Tuinhout, Adriaan de Regt, Maxim Sakovic, Freek de Bruijn, Teije Oudshoorn, Tom Kölker.</em></p>
