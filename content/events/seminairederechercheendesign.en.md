The ‘Research practices in design and creation’ methodology seminar is organised and run jointly by the Dicen-IDF laboratory and the Jean Prouvé Design Chair at the National Conservatory of Arts and Craft (Cnam). Primarily aimed at master's students, young researchers, doctoral candidates and those aspiring to become such, it invites members of research communities linked to the fields of design and creation to contribute together to a better understanding of the methodological issues involved in research as a place for exploration, discussion and the dissemination of ideas and knowledge.

Research in design and creation is a recent field that is still developing. There are several complementary approaches, some of which overlap in their research programmes. Some are part of a well-established tradition of academic research, taking design as the object of study to understand its nature, how it works and its socio-historical context. Others are part of an applied research approach, aimed at formalising methods and tools to help improve design practices. Still others, more recent, use the practice of design as an approach to creating and discussing new knowledge.

Each annual session will consist of four or five papers presenting the work of key players in design and creation research, in terms of their methods and approaches. Some presentations may be in English, in which case they will be transcribed into French. 
The seminar is open to all public. A recording will be made for online publication with the agreement of the speakers.

This seminar is part of course DSN201 at Cnam. Students enrolled on this course will be supported through this seminar and additional teaching and practical work to set up a research project. This course is included in several masters and specialisation certificates and can also be taken on request or as part of the Abbé Grégoire doctoral school.
