<p><em><b>The Practice of Constructive Design Research</b> is a conversation proposed by Stoffel Kuenen at the DRS2014 conference.</em></p>
<p><em>'Catalysts (=invited participants) for the conversation were researchers in this field: Lorenzo Davoli, Mahmoud Keshavarz, Pierre Lévy and Ambra Trotto. In order to feed and frame the conversation, I made a video containing statements taken from interviews with more consolidated researchers: Pelle Ehn, Daniel Fällman, Caroline Hummels, Johan Redström and John Zimmerman.'</em> (Stoffel Kuenen)<p>
