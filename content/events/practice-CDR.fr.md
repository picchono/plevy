***The Practice of Constructive Design Research*** *is a conversation proposed by Stoffel Kuenen at the DRS2014 conference.*

*'Catalysts (=invited participants) for the conversation were researchers in this field: Lorenzo Davoli, Mahmoud Keshavarz, Pierre Lévy and Ambra Trotto. In order to feed and frame the conversation, I made a video containing statements taken from interviews with more consolidated researchers: Pelle Ehn, Daniel Fällman, Caroline Hummels, Johan Redström and John Zimmerman.'*  
(Stoffel Kuenen)
