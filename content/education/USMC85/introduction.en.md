## Briefly about me
I am interested in the way we deal with and transform the world at hand in everyday life. This constant effort of appropriation maintains a certain form of freedom and quietude. While I experiment a lot on my own everyday life, I also try to structure my design teachings and research activities so that I can explore and progress on these inquiries further.  
I am a professor of design of Cnam since 2021. Previously, I have been educated in mechanical engineering (master level), design and neuroscience (during my PhD). My current research is situated in-between the fields of design, information sciences and humanities. I have worked a few years in the industry before entering the academic world. Although I was raised in France, I have lived a long time in Japan and in the Netherlands.
  
## Briefly about the course
This course intends to challenge learners on the way exposing their work can communicate their intend to either convince or create a dialog (by means a rising curiosity and interest). Exploring tools and technics for **writing, visualising and presenting**, this course provides the basics in to improve communication skills in projects and research.

The ambition of a dialogue is to learn from each other in the exchange (the *commun*-ication) between the people in interaction. Also it can be appreciated, it is not the point to agree at the end of the exchange. The point is to work on the effect which the encountering of somebody else's viewpoint has on one's own viewpoint. In other words, is to learn from the other, and provide content for the other to learn from oneself's viewpoint and arguments.  Therefore, the dialogue works well when what is put in common is good enough for each participant to learn and grow out of this moment.

To do so the way arguments are communicated are important. They need to be exposed in a way that they are graspable, understandable, criticizable, adaptable… They need to be arranged so that they are useful for the other's reflection.  That will be the challenge of this course through three ways used in academic ativities : writing, visualising and presenting.

## Objectives
- acquiring techniques for structuring and performing a presentation,
- using and adapting different media for presenting,
- using relevant resources to continue progressing independently.

The development of these skills will be based on projects selected by the learners: their own expertise.

## Structure of the course
- Each course will be composed of small lectures, exercises (not graded), discussions, and an evaluation (graded).
- You are required to have a computer, pens or pencils (multiple colours) and paper.

## Dynamics of the course
- I speak as long as I am not interrupted. Feel free to ask questions, to engage in discussions at any time with the class **\- in a mannerly way.**
- Discussions are open and shared; perspectives may vary and should be appreciated as long as they are constructive and respectful.

## Deliverables
- Deliverables are always **submitted on Moodle**, be careful of deadlines.
- Deadlines will vary between masters (MECA, IOT, TLC). Submit it at the proper place on Moodle, at the correct time.
- Unless specified, deadlines out of course time will be 10 days after the last course.

### Using IA and other tools
- You will use IA, and are authorised to use any other computer tool.
- You **have to** declare how you have used it (for your own research, to support the writing of the deliverable),
- You have to explain your inquiry (prompts) and use of the results.
- What the tool provides you will not be evaluated (eg. if you use the text provided by an IA as is, the text will not be graded), but your wise use of the tool and critical use of the results will be. Therefore, a wise and reflective use of such tools may lead to a good grade.
- Failing to declare the use of such tools will be considered cheating.
