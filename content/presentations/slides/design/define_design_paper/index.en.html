<p>We propose that it may not be possible to define design in this way, and that the field should move away from reiteration and discuss the importance of designâ€™s role as a leader of the global conversation about transdisciplinary approaches to research and design of the future scenarios and emerging pathways of humankind that such pathways point to.</p>
