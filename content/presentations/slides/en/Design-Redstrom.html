<div class="w-full self-center grid grid-cols-2 gap-6">
    <div class="">...the presence of many different definitions is instrumental as we try to understand and articulate what things like "design" or "designing" are; this absence of unified definitions is not a conceptual shortcoming of our thinking but in fact an effective strategy for coping with certain kinds of complexity although this is not something we have made explicit.</div>
    <div class="row-span-2">At times it seems as if one of the key characteristics of design is to base its very existence on the complexities arising from dichotomies. To negotiate form and function. To be about craft and skill and work with industrial pro­ duction. To link production and consumption. To work with free and open processes and to be deeply committed to method. To be user centered and design driven. To be art and science. [...] Design can also be remarkably resilient and willing to commit to all that which is neither black nor white, but <b>complex and colorful</b>.</div>
