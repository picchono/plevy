    <p><ol><li>Creating a design is not about altering the surface appearance. It is about using originality and ingenuity to reform inner mechanisms.</li>   
    <li>True beauty is born, not created.</li>   
    <li>The concept of design is inspired by the action of designing.</li>   
    <li>Design is not a solitary act.</li>   
    <li>An entrepreneur more than anything else must possess a talent for products.</li>   
    <li>Best sellers are not always the best in terms of design. The best designs do not always become best sellers.</li>   
    <li>Talented designers are not solely responsible for good design.</li>   
    <li>True design does battle with trends.</li>   
    <li>Tradition inspires creation. Design is impossible without tradition and creativity.</li>   
    <li>Design is a social issue.</li></ol></p>
