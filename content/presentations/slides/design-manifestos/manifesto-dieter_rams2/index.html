    <div class="leading-tight">1. Good design is innovative</div>
    <div class="petitTxt leading-tight pb-4">The possibilities for innovation are not, by any means, exhausted. Technological
        development is always offering new opportunities for innovative design. But innovative design always develops in
        tandem with innovative technology, and can never be an end in itself.</div>
    <div class="leading-tight">2. Good design makes a product useful</div>
    <div class="petitTxt leading-tight pb-4">A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy certain criteria, not only
        functional,
        but also psychological and aesthetic. Good design emphasises the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding
        anything that could possibly detract from it.</div>
    <div class="leading-tight">3. Good design is aesthetic</div>
    <div class="petitTxt leading-tight pb-4">
        The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because products we
        use every day affect our person and our well-being. But only well-executed objects can be
        beautiful.</div>
    <div class="leading-tight">4. Good design makes a product understandable</div>
    <div class="petitTxt leading-tight pb-4">
        It clarifies the product’s structure. Better still, it can make the product talk.
        At best, it is self-explanatory.</div>
    <div class="leading-tight">5. Good design is unobtrusive</div>
    <div class="petitTxt leading-tight pb-4">
        Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither decorative
        objects nor works of art. Their design should therefore be both neutral and restrained, to leave
        room for the user’s self-expression.</div>
    <div class="leading-tight">6. Good design is honest</div>
    <div class="petitTxt leading-tight pb-4">
        It does not make a product more innovative, powerful or valuable than it
        really is. It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with promises that cannot be
        kept.</div>
    <div class="leading-tight">7. Good design is long-lasting</div>
    <div class="petitTxt leading-tight pb-4">
        It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated.
        Unlike fashionable design, it lasts many years – even in today’s throwaway
        society.</div>
    <div class="leading-tight">8. Good design is thorough down to the last detail</div>
    <div class="petitTxt leading-tight pb-4">
        Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in
        the design process show respect towards the user.</div>
    <div class="leading-tight">9. Good design is environmentally-friendly</div>
    <div class="petitTxt leading-tight pb-4">
        Design makes an important contribution to the preservation of
        the environment. It conserves resources and minimises physical and visual
        pollution throughout the lifecycle of the product.</div>
    <div class="leading-tight">10. Good design is as little design as possible</div>
    <div class="petitTxt leading-tight pb-4">
        Less, but better – because it concentrates on the
        essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with
        non-essentials.</div>
