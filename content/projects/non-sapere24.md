&nbsp;

The school of not-knowing, a collaborative project and event with Civic-City, Ruedi Baur and Vera Bau, the Cnam's Chaire of Design Jean Prouvé, the Institut Français and Estienne / École Supérieure des Arts et Industries Graphiques, is based on the conviction that dialogue between the arts, design, science and society can open up new horizons in our understanding and apprehension of known and yet-to-be-discovered worlds.
Through collaborative and evolving reflection, we question the mysteries and blind spots of today's world and of worlds to come, our relationship with the known, the unknown, the hidden and the buried, questioning representations as well as modes of transmission of non-knowledge.
The aim is to imagine how design can give visibility to what is not visible, make perceptible what is not, and show what cannot be seen. To this end, it is bringing together experts and a network of 30 art and design schools from around the world to examine this non-knowledge together.

The event will take place on February 1 and 2, 2024 in the Salle des Textiles at the CNAM.  
It will be accompanied from February 1 to March 30 by an exhibition of panels from the School of Non-Knowledge at the École Estienne / École Supérieure des Arts et Industries Graphiques.
